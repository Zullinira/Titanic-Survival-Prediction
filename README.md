# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
  - The aim of this project is building a predictive model that shows people were more likely to survive in Titanic Tragedy
  - Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques and Supervised Learning (Machine Learning)
  - Using K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) (Accuracy : 81%)
