#  âœ¨Titanic-Survival-Prediction âœ¨
  - The aim of this project is building a predictive model that shows people were more likely to survive in Titanic Tragedy
  - Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Supervised Learning (Decition Tree, Logistic Regression, K-Nearset Neighbors (K-NN))
  
# ðŸŒŸ Code and Resources :
- Language : Python 3.7.3
- Library : Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- Dataset : link dataset( https://github.com/Zullinira/Titanic-Survival-Prediction/blob/main/test.csv) and (https://github.com/Zullinira/Titanic-Survival-Prediction/blob/main/train1.csv)

# ðŸŒŸ Input: 
  - Dataset Train (.csv) [link download dataset](https://github.com/Zullinira/Titanic-Survival-Prediction/blob/main/train1.csv)
  - Dataset Test to apply model (.csv) [link download dataset](https://github.com/Zullinira/Titanic-Survival-Prediction/blob/main/test.csv)
  
# ðŸŒŸ Output :
  - Predict Model how will survive in Titanic Tragedy
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) has a higher accuracy than other algorithms
